<H1>Simply Logical bigger assignment</H1>

The assignment deals with natural language and search. 
Most of the relevant material can be found in Chapters 5-7 of the book. 
The file to be used is <A HREF=cw.pl><B>cw.pl</B></A>. <P>

The goal of this assignment is to implement a basic travel planner for train journeys 
that can answer questions in natural language (ambiguity intended :-). 
Use the timetable in <A HREF=cw.pl><B>cw.pl</B></A>.
<P>

The program will contain 3 parts: 
<UL>
<LI>a grammar - used for both interpretation of questions and generation of answers; 
<LI>a search engine - notice the search space contains many loops; 
<LI>a shell - use <B>handle_input</B> on p.143 as a starting point.
</UL>
<P>

<LI>
In a first step, make sure the program can answer the following questions: 
<PRE>
? [what,time,do,i,have,to,leave,bristol,in,order,to,be,in,brussels,at,16:30]. 
! [if,you,leave,bristol,at,10:15,you,will,arrive,in,brussels,at,16:10].
? [if,i,leave,bristol,at,12:00,what,time,will,i,arrive,in,brussels].
! [if,you,leave,bristol,at,12:15,you,will,arrive,in,brussels,at,18:10].
</PRE>
Variations on these questions also need to be understood, e.g. "When" instead of 
"What time", "should I" instead of "do I have to", "if I want" instead of "in order", 
etc. Also make sure that your system graciously handles questions it doesn't understand.
<P>

You can earn max. 35% for the grammar part for this question and 35% for the search part. 
<P>

<LI>
The second step is to handle questions that can only be understood in the context 
of a particular journey: 
<PRE>
? [what,time,do,i,have,to,leave,bristol,in,order,to,be,in,brussels,at,16:30].
! [if,you,leave,bristol,at,10:15,you,will,arrive,in,brussels,at,16:10].
? [is,there,an,earlier,possibility].
! [if,you,leave,bristol,at,9:15,you,will,arrive,in,brussels,at,15:10].
? [do,i,have,to,change].
! [yes,you,have,to,change,in,london,for,the,11:27,to,brussels].
? [what,time,do,i,arrive,in,london].
! [you,arrive,in,london,at,11:00].
</PRE>
Again, the parser should be robust and understand variations on these questions. 
Your shell will now need to carry a journey around as a context against which 
some of the questions will be understood. Note that the context may change as a 
result of a question. 
<P>

You can earn max. 30% for handling context.
