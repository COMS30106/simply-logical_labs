<H1>Sicstus tracer</H1>

You can trace Prolog's computations by giving the command <B>?-trace.</B> 
This will put Prolog in trace mode, showing every single resolution step 
(except for the predicates that have been compiled rather than consulted). 
Trace mode is switched off by the command <B>?-notrace.</B> 
<P>

We will follow the computation trace of the query <B>?-student_of(S,peter).</B>, 
depicted in Figure 3.1 on page 45 of the book. 
Load the file <A HREF=student_of.pl><B>student_of.pl</B></A>.

| ?- trace.
{The debugger will first creep -- showing everything (trace)}

yes
{trace}
| ?- student_of(S,peter).
        1      1 Call: student_of(_158,peter) ?
        2      2 Call: follows(_158,_648) ?
?       2      2 Exit: follows(paul,computer_science) ?
        3      2 Call: teaches(peter,computer_science) ?
        3      2 Exit: teaches(peter,computer_science) ?
?       1      1 Exit: student_of(paul,peter) ?

S = paul ? ;

After each line of output we can give a command; <B>h</B> lists the possible options. 
For the moment we are just stepping through the computation by hitting <B>RETURN</B>.
The relation with SLD-trees is as follows. A <B>Call</B> means passing through a 
node in the SLD-tree in downward direction; only the first literal of the resolvent 
is shown. <B>Exit</B> means passing upward through a node. The first number to the 
left indicates the depth of the node in the SLD-tree; the second number indicates 
the level at which that literal first occurred in the resolvent. For instance, 
<B>teaches(peter,computer_science)</B> is called at level 3, but is introduced 
(with the second argument uninstantiated) at level 2. <P>

We have found our first solution, and force backtracking by typing a semi-colon as usual. 
Notice that Sicstus indicates nodes with possible alternative solutions with a 
question mark in the left margin. We thus backtrack to the most recent choice point 
at 2 2.

S = maria ? ;

<B>Redo</B> indicates the search for an alternative solution; notice that 
the literal following <B>Redo</B> is the most recently found answer rather than the 
query to which we seek an alternative solution (see the <B>Call</B> at the same level). 
The second solution for <B>follows(S,C)</B> at 2 2 leads to a failure branch, because 
we can't solve <B>teaches(peter,expert_systems)</B> at 3 2. We thus redo 2 2 (the question 
mark showing that not all choices have been exhausted), after which we find our second 
solution. <P>

Note that there is still a question mark at 3 2, indicating possible alternative 
solutions -- this is because <B>teaches(peter,ai_techniques)</B> is not the last 
<B>teaches</B> fact in the program. Forced backtracking however shows that all 
solutions have been exhausted.
