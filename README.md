# Lab exercises for Simply Logical book #
[Here](https://simply-logical.space/labs/) you can find the original lab exercises designed for this book. I have model answers to the first four sets of exercises -- contact me if you're interested (and if you're not a student!).  

For the most recent lab exercises, go to the [COMS30106 site](https://www.cs.bris.ac.uk/Teaching/Resources/COMS30106/).
