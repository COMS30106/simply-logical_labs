<LI>Describe and explain the two differences in behaviour between the
predicates <B>powerset</B> and <B>powerset1</B>. <P>
<LI>Make <B>powerset</B> tail-recursive by adding an accumulator as extra
argument. <P>

<LI>
The well-known 8-puzzle consists of 8 tiles and an empty space, organised in a square. 
A move consists in sliding a tile to the empty space. 
The objective is to reach the following position: 
<PRE>
   1 2 3
   8   4
   7 6 5
</PRE>

Such a position will be represented by a list
<PRE>       [XE/YE,X1/Y1,X2/Y2,X3/Y3,X4/Y4,X5/Y5,X6/Y6,X7/Y7,X8/Y8]
</PRE>
with the first pair denoting the coordinates of the empty space,
<TT>X1/Y1</TT> denoting the coordinates of tile 1, and so on. 
Coordinates <TT>1/1</TT> refer to the lower left square. 
The position above is thus represented by the list 
<PRE>       [2/2,1/3,2/3,3/3,3/2,3/1,2/1,1/1,1/2]
</PRE>

<UL>
<LI>The 'Manhattan distance' is the sum of the horizontal and vertical distance between 
two squares. Write a predicate <B>mandist(X1/Y1,X2/Y2,D)</B> for calculating 
this distance. <P>
<LI>Write a predicate <B>move_p(P1,P2)</B> indicating whether position <B>P2</B> 
can be reached from position <B>P1</B> in a single move. 
Use the predicate <B>mandist</B>. <P>
</UL>

<LI>
The predicate <B>prove_e(Goal,Explanation)</B> returns an explanation with the answer 
to a query: 
<PRE>
| ?- prove_e(student_of(S,T),Explanation).

S = paul,
T = peter,
Explanation = student_of(paul,peter)because(follows(paul,computer_science)because given)and(teaches(peter,computer_science)because given) ? ;

S = paul,
T = adrian,
Explanation = student_of(paul,adrian)because(follows(paul,expert_systems)because given)and(teaches(adrian,expert_systems)because given) ? ;

S = maria,
T = peter,
Explanation = student_of(maria,peter)because(follows(maria,ai_techniques)because given)and(teaches(peter,ai_techniques)because given) ? ;

no
</PRE>
Notice that <B>because</B> and <B>and</B> are declared as infix functors. 
Also notice that any predicate on which we use <B>clause(Head,Body)</B> should be 
declared as dynamic. <P>

<UL>
<LI>Explanations can become long-winded when for instance the <B>append</B>-predicate is 
involved. Modify <B>prove_e</B> such that only the top-level call to such predicates is 
included in the explanation: 
<PRE>
| ?- prove_e(sublist1(SL,[a,b]),Explanation).

SL = [],
Explanation = sublist1([],[a,b])because append([],[a,b],[a,b])and append([],[a,b],[a,b]) ? ;

SL = [a],
Explanation = sublist1([a],[a,b])because append([],[a,b],[a,b])and append([a],[b],[a,b]) ? ;

SL = [a,b],
Explanation = sublist1([a,b],[a,b])because append([],[a,b],[a,b])and append([a,b],[],[a,b]) ? ;

SL = [],
Explanation = sublist1([],[a,b])because append([a],[b],[a,b])and append([],[b],[b]) ? ;

SL = [b],
Explanation = sublist1([b],[a,b])because append([a],[b],[a,b])and append([b],[],[b]) ? ;

SL = [],
Explanation = sublist1([],[a,b])because append([a,b],[],[a,b])and append([],[],[]) ? ;

no
</PRE>
Make use of the built-in predicate <B>call(Goal)</B> to prove goals without explaining them. <P>
<LI>Modify <B>prove_e</B> such that it can handle negation: 
<PRE>
| ?- prove_e(bachelor(X),Explanation).
X = peter,
Explanation = bachelor(peter)because(man(peter)because given)and(not married(peter)) ?
</PRE>
