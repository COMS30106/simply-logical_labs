<H1>Simply Logical lab exercises chapter 2</H1>

The exercises are about models for propositional, relational and full clausal logic. <P>

The file <A HREF=herbrand.pl><B>herbrand.pl</B></A> 
implements the semantical notions discussed in this chapter, 
such as Herbrand base, interpretation and model. For instance, you can use it to generate 
all Herbrand interpretations of a given list of clauses, and to check whether 
a given clause is a logical consequence of a given list of clauses. 
Have a look at the file and you will see that, although you may not yet understand 
all Prolog constructs used there, the Prolog definitions follow the definitions given 
in the lectures fairly closely. <P>

To use these programs, you have to specify which predicates, constants and functors 
there are in your language. Example propositional/relational/full clausal languages 
are given in the files 
<A HREF=prop.pl><B>prop.pl</B></A>, 
<A HREF=rel.pl><B>rel.pl</B></A>, and
<A HREF=full.pl><B>full.pl</B></A>.
Loading one of these files will automatically load 
<A HREF=herbrand.pl><B>herbrand.pl</B></A>. 
You will also need the files
<A HREF=../programs/library.pl><B>library.pl</B></A> and
<A HREF=../programs/aux_sicstus.pl><B>aux_sicstus.pl</B></A>.

<LI>
Consult <A HREF=prop.pl><B>prop.pl</B></A>.
This defines a propositional clausal language. 
Check which one by means of the query <B>?-herbrand_base(B).</B> <P>

The following query can be used to generate the Herbrand models of the 
program in Exercise 2.2 (p.20): 
<PRE>
?- herbrand_model([(bachelor;married:-man,adult),(man:-true),(false:-bachelor)], M).
</PRE> 
Note: 
<OL>
<LI>we need brackets around the clauses because of overloading of ':-', ';' and ','
<LI>the empty body is represented by <TT>true</TT> and the empty head by <TT>false</TT>
</OL> <P>

To check that <TT>married:-adult</TT> is a logical consequence of this program you can use the query
<PRE>
?- logical_consequence((married:-adult),
                       [(bachelor;married:-man,adult),(man:-true),(false:-bachelor)],
                       Answer).
Answer = yes
</PRE>
In case the clause given as the first argument is <B>not</B> a logical consequence 
of the program given as second argument, this program returns a <B>countermodel</B> 
(a model of the program that is <B>not</B> a model of the clause): 
<PRE>
?- logical_consequence((bachelor:-man),
                       [(bachelor;married:-man,adult),(man:-true),(false:-bachelor)],
                       Answer).
Answer = countermodel([man]) 
</PRE>
Notice that, because of the 'hidden' cut in the <TT>( if -> then ; else )</TT>
construct (Section 3.4 of the book), this program stops with
the first countermodel it finds, and cannot be used to generate all countermodels. <P>

<UL>
<LI>
Add a propositional atom <TT>woman</TT> to the language, 
and check that the Herbrand base is now enlarged. 
Express in clausal logic "somebody is a woman if and only if she is not a man" (2 clauses) 
and demonstrate that in each model of these two clauses exactly one of <TT>man/woman</TT> is true
by listing all answers to the query <B>?-herbrand_model([...],M)</B>. <P>

<LI>
Find a list of clauses that has exactly the following models: 
<PRE>
?- herbrand_model([...],M).
M = [woman] ? ;
M = [man] ? ;
M = [adult,woman] ? ;
M = [adult,married,woman] ? ;
M = [adult,man,married] ? ;
M = [adult,bachelor,man] ? ;
no
</PRE>

Hint: this requires 7 clauses, all of which are true (more or less) in the actual world. <P>
</UL>

<HR>


<LI>
Consult <A HREF=rel.pl><B>rel.pl</B></A>.
This defines a relational clausal language. 
Check which one by means of the query <B>?-herbrand_base(B).</B> <P>

According to the answer to Exercise 2.6 (p.215) the clause 
<TT>likes(peter,S):-student_of(S,peter)</TT> has 144 models 
(check the calculation, and verify by means of a query!). 
We are going to reduce the number of models by adding information. <P>

<UL>
<LI>
Express in clausal logic (1 clause each): 
<OL>
<LI>Everybody likes him/herself. 
<LI>Nobody is a student of him/herself. 
<LI>Peter is a student of nobody.
</OL> <P>

<LI>
Now, determine all models of these 4 clauses (incl. the one above). <BR>
NB. When checking this by means of the program <B>herbrand_model</B>, 
you should make sure that no variables occur in more than one clause. <P>

<LI>
Finally, determine whether "nobody is a student of Maria" is a logical consequence 
of these clauses. <P>
</UL>

<HR>


<LI>
Since any subset of the Herbrand base is a Herbrand interpretation, the <B>intersection</B> 
of two Herbrand interpretations is also a Herbrand interpretation, assigning <B>true</B> 
to an atom just in case the original interpretations <B>both</B> assign true to it. 
We say that a program has the <B>model intersection property</B> if the intersection 
of any two of its models is also a model. For instance, the following program has 
the model intersection property (check!): 
<PRE>
   adult:-married. 
   man. 
</PRE>
but the following does not (check!): 
<PRE>
   married;bachelor:-man,adult.
   adult:-married. 
   man. 
</PRE> <P>

Find out which of the following programs has the model intersection property: 
<OL>
<LI><PRE>   man:-bachelor.
   adult:-bachelor.
   bachelor.</PRE>
<LI><PRE>   man:-bachelor.
   adult:-bachelor.
   married;bachelor.</PRE>
<LI><PRE>   man:-bachelor.
   adult:-bachelor.
   :-married.</PRE>
<LI><PRE>   man:-bachelor.
   adult:-bachelor.</PRE>
</OL>

<HR>


<LI>
Consult <A HREF=full.pl><B>full.pl</B></A>.
This defines a full clausal language. 
Check which one by means of the query <B>?-herbrand_base(B).</B> <P>

Actually you should have known better, since the Herbrand base of a 
full clausal langauge is infinite! 
Check this by asking for a few solutions to the query <B>?-ground_term(T).</B> 
and <B>?-ground_atom(A).</B>
As a consequence, none of the predicates <B>herbrand_interpretation</B>, 
<B>herbrand_model</B> and <B>logical_consequence</B> will terminate, since 
they all generate interpretations from the Herbrand base. <P>

If we modify the program a little bit, we can however continue to check 
whether a clause is true in an interpretation. 
Consider the following definition of <B>false_clause</B>:
<PRE>
false_clause((false:-Body),I):-
        ground_clause((false:-Body)),
        true_body(Body,I).
false_clause((Head:-Body),I):-
        ground_clause((Head:-Body)),
        true_body(Body,I),
        not true_head(Head,I).
</PRE>
The problem is that <B>ground_clause</B> may generate an infinite number of 
substitutions before hitting on a falsifying one. 
However, any variables in the body of the clause will also be ground by 
the call <B>true_body(Body,I)</B>. 
So if we make sure that we don't test clauses with head variables that do not 
occur in the body, we may remove the calls to <B>ground_clause</B>. <P>

<UL>
<LI>
Make this modification, and then check which of the following clauses is true 
in the interpretation <TT>{plus(0,0,0), plus(0,s(0),s(0), plus(s(0),0,s(0)}</TT>: 
<OL>
<LI><TT>plus(s(X),Y,s(Z)):-plus(X,Y,Z).</TT>
<LI><TT>plus(X,Y,Z):-plus(s(X),Y,s(Z)).</TT>
<LI><TT>:-plus(X,X,s(X)).</TT>
</OL>
For each clause that is false in the given interpretation, give a ground instance 
that is false. <P>
</UL>
